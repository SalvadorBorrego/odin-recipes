        <!-- Description -->

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mexico is best known for <em>“los antojitos”</em>, which include tostadas, empanadas, huaraches, and sopes to name a few. One of the most popular of the antojitos are chicken flautas.</p>
        <p><strong>Flautas</strong> are originally from Sinaloa, which is a state in northern Mexico, not too far from the United States. That is one of the reasons that their popularity has spread to many parts of the United States. Flautas consist of a corn tortilla, filled with different ingredients such as the shredded chicken in this recipe, but it can also include beef or mashed potatoes. They are then rolled up and fried to golden-brown perfection.</p>
